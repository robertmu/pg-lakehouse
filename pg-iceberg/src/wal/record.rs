/// WAL record operation types for Iceberg
///
/// This enum defines the three basic file system operations that are logged
/// to the WAL for crash recovery on local file systems:
/// - DeleteDirectory: Remove a directory and its contents
/// - WriteFile: Write data to a file (creates file and parent directories if offset is 0)
/// - DeleteFile: Remove a file
///
/// Note: These WAL records are only used for local file systems. Distributed
/// storage (S3, GCS, Azure) guarantees durability and doesn't need WAL-based
/// redo. Orphaned files on distributed storage should be cleaned up via a
/// separate garbage collection mechanism (e.g., Iceberg's expire_snapshots).
