//! Iceberg-specific pending delete implementation.
//!
//! This module provides the pending delete mechanism for Iceberg tables,
//! allowing table directories to be cleaned up when transactions abort (for CREATE)
//! or commit (for DROP).
//!
//! # Background
//!
//! This is an implementation of `pg_tam::access::pending_delete::PendingDelete`
//! tailored for Iceberg. It uses `iceberg_lite::io::FileIO` to physically
//! remove table directories from storage (Local, S3, GCS, etc.) when
//! the transaction reaches the appropriate state.
//!
//! # WAL Logging
//!
//! WAL logging for directory deletion is only performed for **local storage**.
//! This ensures that standby nodes and crash recovery can properly replay
//! the deletion.
//!
//! For **distributed storage** (S3, GCS, Azure), WAL logging is not used because:
//! 1. The storage is shared between primary and standby, so only one deletion is needed
//! 2. Orphaned files should be cleaned via garbage collection (e.g., Iceberg's expire_snapshots)
